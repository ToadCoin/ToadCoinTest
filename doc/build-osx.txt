See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Toadcoin-QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.8 and 10.9 (Intel).  Older versions of OS X (10.5 and 10.6) should be possible, but have not been tested. PowerPC (TOAD) is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app (/Applications/Utilities)

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. You can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

<<<<<<< HEAD
git clone git@github.com:toadcoin/toadcoin.git
=======
git clone git@github.com:peershares/peershares.git
>>>>>>> ac6a1f917cac54cb628973f14d13f574a7eafdc7

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

2a. (for maximum compatibility with 32-bit installs)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build bitcoind:

<<<<<<< HEAD
cd toadcoin/src
=======
cd peershares/src
>>>>>>> ac6a1f917cac54cb628973f14d13f574a7eafdc7
make -f makefile.osx
# To build 64-bit binaies:
make -f makefile.osx RELEASE=true 64BIT=true

Run:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ./toadcoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./toadcoind -daemon # to start the bitcoin daemon.
Run
  ./toadcoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
=======
  ./peersharesd --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./peersharesd -daemon # to start the bitcoin daemon.
Run
  ./peersharesd help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
